Given two array's with elements (similar to same), check how many connecting
lines there are between the two arrays
x [1, 4, 2]
y [1, 2, 4]

1 and 1 connect 
4 and 4 connect, but 2 and 2 cannot connect because of an overlapping ilne

x [1, 4, 2]
   |    \
y [1, 2, 4]

or

x [1, 4, 2]
   |    /
y [1, 2, 4]
