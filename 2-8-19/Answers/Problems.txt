//1: Create method that takes an int as an argument.
// Add up all the numbers from 1 to the number tou passed into the function.
//For example, if the input is 4, then your function should return 10
// because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10

// 2: Create a method which takes an array of ints between 1 and 10
// (Excluding one number) and returns the midding number.
//
// Extra challenge: solve without the use of a for loop

''' 3: Divide without division, multiplcation, or modulus '''

/* 4: Get start and end number, and print out how many numbers
there are in between EXCLUDING ANY NUMBER with 5.
